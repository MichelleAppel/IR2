Information Retrieval provides the ability of retrieving relevant information sources given a query. An information source is relevant if a user gets desired information from it. To obtain such relevant sources, different methods can be used whereof in this research methods that evaluate document content are considered. Those methods include tf-idf (term frquency - inverted index frequency), BM25 (best match 25), Jelinek-Mercer, Dirichlet prior, absolute discounting, positional language model, LSI (latent semantic index), LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) and in addition WAWE (weighted average word embeddings) and DESM (dual embedding space model). All different methods are tested using different metrics in comparison to the ground truth relevance.
